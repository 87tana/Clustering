## Customer Segmentation on Mall Dataset 
You are running a supermarket mall and through membership cards, you have some basic data about your customers like customer ID, age, gender, annual income and spending score. You want to understand the customers, such as who the target customers are, so that the marketing team can make sense of them and plan strategy accordingly. Since the customers' spending scores are the main factor for the marketing team, the main objective is to find meaningful clusters of customers with respect to their spending scores.

For this purpose, I use an unsupervised machine learning algorithm namely k-means on the Mll customer data with 200 samples obtained from the Kaggle dataset.
